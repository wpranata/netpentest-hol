Introduction
============

What is Penetration Testing
---------------------------
Penetration Testing (Pentest) is an act of simulating real cyber attacks to **assess the risk associated with potential security breaches**. 
Basically: it's **hacking with jurisdiction**.

People do Pentest for many reasons.
But in the end, the goal is to **identify security weaknesses** in a network, machine, or piece of software.
Once they're caught, the people maintaining the systems or software can eliminate or reduce the weaknesses before hostile parties discover them. 

Phases in Penetration Testing
-----------------------------

Pre-enggagements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before starting a Pentest, we need to **set the boundaries and goals** of this activity.
This will be especially important if we are working with a client, since clients often have areas that they want you to stay away from, no matter what.

In this phase, we would want to **talk to our client** (if it is a personal Pentest, just **ask ourselves**).
Set limitations, such as: the scope of the attack, the time limitation for the test, the boundaries of where we will be working, the testing type, and so on.

.. note::

    There are many types of testing. We can categorize them into 3 types:

    - **Black Box Testing**: the pentester has **zero-knowledge** about their intended target.
    - **Grey Box Testing**: the pentester has **partial-knowledge** about their intended target.
    - **White Box Testing**: the pentester has **full-knowledge** about their intended target.

.. caution::

    Once boundaries are set, make sure **you NEVER cross it**.
    Boundaries are set for a reason, and if you disrespect that reason, your client will most likely be very, very unhappy.

Information Gathering
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is the first step of Pentest.
In this phase, our task is to **find the target, and collect as much information as possible**.

The information could be something arbitrary (such as the target's name (if it's a person or an organization), their goals, what they are doing, where they are located), or something very specific (such as their IP Address, open ports, service versions, domain names).
The point is, just **collect as much information as possible**.

Here, we will be using tools, such as :ref:`ping<pingpage>`, :ref:`traceroute<traceroute>`, nmap, and more.

.. note::

    Information Gathering phase is not limited to tools and search engines.
    We could also utilize our social skills in asking around, maybe even trick someone into spilling information about our target (also famously known as **Social Engineering**).

Vulnerability Analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Analysis is an extension to the previous phase, `Information Gathering`_.
This is where we dive deeper into the information that we have found.

In this phase, our goal is to **look for exploits or vulnerabilities** that we can leverage for our next phase.
For example, from the service versions that we have found from the previous step, we could look for vulnerabilities that existed for that specific version.

This phase is more geared towards research. Websites like :ref:`ExploitDB<exploit-db>` can be a great assist.

Exploitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
If our Vulnerability Analysis bears fruit, we can proceed to the next phase: Exploitation.

This is the phase where the action happens.
In this phase, our goal is to **exploit the vulnerabilities** we previously found.

Exploitation can have different goals, such as:

- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Remote Code Execution (RCE)
- Data Extraction
- Gaining Access
- And so on...

Exploitation tools vary by mangnitudes, due to the vast amout of vulnerabilities around the world.
In this HOL, we will be using tools such as Metasploit and SQLMap.

Post-Exploitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Post-Exploitation refers to our actions after a successful (or failed) exploitation.

Some things to be done after an exploitation:
    - Environment Exploration
    - Privilege Escalation
    - Planting a malicious code (such as a backdoor or a timed bomb)
    - Cleaning traces (Cleanup)

Reporting
~~~~~~~~~
To be an ethical pentester, we should always report our findings, especially if we are working with a client.

Some of the most important things to report are:

    - Scope of testing
    - Details of tests performed, their results, and their implications
    - Suggestions, advices, and recommendations

This phase might be the most boring, but it is also the most important.
What we find in our Pentest might help future clients, developers, code maintainers, and others, in improving their own system security.

What do you need
----------------
The most important thing to own when it comes to Pentest is the **willpower to learn**.
Cyber security grows at such an alarming rate, it takes effort to keep up.
If you want to be a successful pentester, you have to **learn how to learn effectively**.

Basic knowledge around computer hardware, software, and common operating systems (such as Windows and Linux) can also help on our journey.
These won't be covered in this HOL, since it is an entirely different scope.

Tools-wise, you can start by visiting the :ref:`setup page<setup>`.

Final advice
------------
Just like everything else, Pentest is a learning process.
Every time there is something new that you are not familiar with, I suggest you **research on it immediately**.
Take notes, review consistently, and grow your knowledge.

.. note::

   Network Penetration Testing is a very dynamic topic.
   This HOL will not cover absolutely everything there is to know about.
   But it is a good jumping board for your dive into the world of Cyber Security.
