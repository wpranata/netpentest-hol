Reporting
=========
Reporting is a set of documentation after penetration testing is conducted.

Reporting is very important, since what we find in our Pentest might help future clients, developers, code maintainers, and others, in improving their own system security.

There are no concrete report templates. Generally, a report consists of 6 parts:

Executive Summary
-----------------
Executive Summary contains the **summarized version of the whole report**.
This part summarizes information, such as **the testing location**, **testing limitations**, **vulnerabilities found**, **mitigation methodologies**, and **recommendations**.

Executive Summary must be brief, concise, and accurate, since this is the first part read by the stakeholders. 

Enggagement Procedure
---------------------
Enggagement procedure contains information about **pre-enggagement procedures** that has been established with the client.
This part talks about the boundaries and goals of the pentest, such as **time limitations**, **space and location limitation**, **testing methodologies**, **testing types**, **considerations**, and so on.

Target Architecture and Composition
-----------------------------------
Target Architecture and Composition refers to the **target's architectural specifications**.
This part talks about the target composition; what kind of **Operating System** is it running, what **services** are active, the **condition** of the target, and so on.

Findings
--------
Every findings will be included in this part.
This part talks about the result of **every activity conducted** by the pentester, successful or not.

The result might consists of something as: **the activity conducted**, **brief details of the result**, **CVSS scores**, **mitigation recommendation**, and so on.

Conclusion
----------
This part **concludes the pentester's findings**.
In this part, the pentester can talk about **the highlights of the findings**, **recommended mitigation methods**, and **further actions**.
