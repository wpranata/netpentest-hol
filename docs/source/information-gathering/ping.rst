Ping
====
A ping_ (Packet Internet or Inter-Network Groper) is a basic Internet program that allows a user to **test and verify if a particular destination IP address exists** and can accept requests in computer network administration.
The acronym was contrived to match the submariners' term for the sound of a returned sonar pulse.

ping_ is also used diagnostically to ensure that a host computer the user is trying to reach is operating.
Any *operating system (OS)* with networking capability, including most embedded network administration software, can use ping.
