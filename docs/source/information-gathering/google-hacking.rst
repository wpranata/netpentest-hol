Google Dorking
==============
Google dorking is a hacking technique that makes use of Google's advanced search services to locate valuable data or hard-to-find content.

Google dorking is also known as "Google hacking".

At the surface level, Google dorking involves using specific modifiers to search data.
For example, instead of searching the entire Web, users can click on tags like "image" or "site" to collect images or find information about a specific site.
Users can utilize other commands like ``filetype:`` and ``datarange:`` to get other specific search results.

Usage
-----
We can either user Google's `advanced search <https://www.google.com/advanced_search>`_ feature, or manually apply Google's search filters into our query.

Example
-------
To find websites on .edu domains that contain the words "login", we can search for ``inurl:edu "login"``

To look for ``Laptop`` products strictly in ``shopee.co.id``: ``site:shopee.co.id "laptop"``
