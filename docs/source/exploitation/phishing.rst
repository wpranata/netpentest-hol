Notice the attack tries to pose as ``outlook@microsoft.com``. Since they cannot use the exact same email, they use a very similar ``outlok@microscop.com`` email in hopes for the victim to fell for the fake email.

Web Phishing
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another famous example is web phishing, where the attacker forges a similar-looking website to lure the victim into doing a certain action.

We can easily do this attack by using SEToolKit_ to generate and host our fake website.

This is a perfect clone of Facebook.
Notice the URL is ``192.168.233.131``, which is the IP of the attacker's device.

Since this website is hosted on the attacker's device, every input will be recorded by the attacker.
When a victim enters their credential, it will be collected and displayed on the attacker's machine.
