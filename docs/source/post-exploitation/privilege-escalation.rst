Privilege Escalation
====================
Privilege escalation happens when a malicious user exploits a bug, design flaw, or configuration error in an application or operating system to gain elevated access to resources that should normally be unavailable to them.

There are many ways to escalate privileges within a system; the most common being having access into more authoritative credentials, through data leaks, phishing, or social engineering.

Example
-------
One example of privilege escalation is the Docker Socket exploitation; utilizing an exposed Docker Socket to escape a container into the host's machine.

In the example video below, a Docker Socket is exposed within a container.
The socket is then utilized by the exploited container to create another container that mounts the host's volume into itself, creating a loop.
The host's volume is then accessible by the second-layer container.
