Common Vulnerability Scoring System
===================================
`The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) <https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document>`_ provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity.

The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as ``low`` ``medium`` ``high`` and ``critical``) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their vulnerability management processes.

.. note::

   The provided information is based on the `CVSS v3.1 Specification Document <https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document>`_.

Metrics
-------
CVSS is composed of three metric groups: ``Base`` ``Temporal`` and ``Environmental``.

The **Base metric group** represents the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are **constant over time** and across user environments.
This is the pure basic score for the vulnerability.

The **Temporal metric group** reflects the characteristics of a vulnerability that **may change over time but not across user environments**.
For example, the presence of a simple-to-use exploit kit would increase the CVSS score, while the creation of an official patch would decrease it.

The **Environmental metric group** represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are **relevant and unique to a particular user's environment**.
Considerations include the presence of security controls which may mitigate some or all consequences of a successful attack, and the relative importance of a vulnerable system within a technology infrastructure.

Scoring
-------
When the **Base metrics** are assigned values by an analyst, the **Base equation** computes a score ranging from ``0.0`` to ``10.0``.

The **Base Score** can then be refined by scoring the **Temporal** and **Environmental** metrics in order to more accurately reflect the relative severity posed by a vulnerability to a user's environment at a specific point in time.
Scoring the Temporal and Environmental metrics is not required, but **is recommended for more precise scores**.

   To make CVSS score calculation easier, you can use the `CVSS 3.1 Calculator <https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1>`_.

Base Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 8 metrics in the Base Scoring equation:

- ``AV`` ``Attack Vector``
- ``AC`` ``Attack Complexity``
- ``PR`` ``Privileges Required``
- ``UI`` ``user Interaction``
- ``S`` ``Scope``
- ``C`` ``Confidentiality``
- ``I`` ``Integrity``
- ``A`` ``Availability``

AV | Attack Vector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This metric reflects **the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible**.

==================  ===============================================================================================
Metric Value        Description
==================  ===============================================================================================
``N`` ``Network``   The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, including the entire Internet.
``A`` ``Adjacent``  The vulnerable component is must be exploited from the same shared physical or logical network.
``L`` ``Local``     The vulnerable component is not bound to the network stack
``P`` ``Physical``  The attack requires the attacker to physically touch or manipulate the vulnerable component.
==================  ===============================================================================================

AC | Attack Complexity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This metric describes **the conditions beyond the attacker's control that must exist** in order to exploit the vulnerability.

==================  ===============================================================================================
Metric Value        Description
==================  ===============================================================================================
``L`` ``Low``       Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist.
``H`` ``High``      A successful attack depends on conditions beyond the attacker's control.
==================  ===============================================================================================

PR | Privileges Required
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This metric describes **the level of privileges an attacker must possess** before successfully exploiting the vulnerability.

==================  ===============================================================================================
Metric Value        Description
==================  ===============================================================================================
``N`` ``None``      The attacker does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.
``L`` ``Low``       The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user.
``H`` ``High``      The attacker requires privileges that provide significant control over the vulnerable component allowing access to component-wide settings and files.
==================  ===============================================================================================

UI | user Interaction
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This metric captures **the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate** in the successful compromise of the vulnerable component. 

==================  ===============================================================================================
Metric Value        Description
==================  ===============================================================================================
``N`` ``None``      The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.
``R`` ``Required``  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited.
==================  ===============================================================================================

S | Scope
^^^^^^^^^
The Scope metric captures whether a vulnerability in one vulnerable component **impacts resources in components beyond its security scope**.

===================  ===============================================================================================
Metric Value         Description
===================  ===============================================================================================
``U`` ``Unchanged``  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority.
``C`` ``Changed``    An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component.
===================  ===============================================================================================

C | Confidentiality
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This metric measures **the impact to the confidentiality of the information resources** managed by a software component due to a successfully exploited vulnerability.
Confidentiality refers to **limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users**, as well as **preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones**.

==================  ===============================================================================================
Metric Value        Description
==================  ===============================================================================================
``H`` ``High``      There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker.
``L`` ``Low``       There is some loss of confidentiality.
``N`` ``None``      There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.
==================  ===============================================================================================

I | Integrity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This metric measures **the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability**.
Integrity refers to **the trustworthiness and veracity of information**.

==================  ===============================================================================================
Metric Value        Description
==================  ===============================================================================================
``H`` ``High``      There is a total loss of integrity, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker.
``L`` ``Low``       There is some loss of integrity.
``N`` ``None``      There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.
==================  ===============================================================================================

A | Availability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This metric measures **the impact to the availability of the impacted component** resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability.
Availability refers to **the loss of availability of the impacted component itself**.

==================  ===============================================================================================
Metric Value        Description
==================  ===============================================================================================
``H`` ``High``      There is a total loss of availability, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker.
``L`` ``Low``       There is some loss of availability.
``N`` ``None``      There is no loss of availability within the impacted component.
==================  ===============================================================================================

Temporal Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 3 metrics in the Temporal Scoring equation:

- ``E`` ``Exploit Code Maturity``
- ``RL`` ``Remediation Level``
- ``RC`` ``Report Confidence``

E | Exploit Code Maturity
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This metric measures **the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked**, and is typically based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or active, "in-the-wild" exploitation.

========================== ===============================================================================================
Metric Value               Description
========================== ===============================================================================================
``X`` ``Not Defined``      Assigning this value indicates there is insufficient information to choose one of the other values. It has the same effect on scoring as assigning High.
``H`` ``High``             Functional autonomous code exists, or no exploit is required (manual trigger) and details are widely available.
``F`` ``Functional``       Functional exploit code is available. The code works in most situations where the vulnerability exists.
``P`` ``Proof-of-Concept`` Proof-of-concept exploit code is available, or an attack demonstration is not practical for most systems.
``U`` ``Unproven``         No exploit code is available, or an exploit is theoretical.
========================== ===============================================================================================

RL | Remediation Level
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Remediation Level of a vulnerability is an important factor for prioritization.
The less official and permanent a fix, the higher the vulnerability score.

========================== ===============================================================================================
Metric Value               Description
========================== ===============================================================================================
``X`` ``Not Defined``      Assigning this value indicates there is insufficient information to choose one of the other values. It has the same effect on scoring as assigning Unavailable.
``U`` ``Unavailable``      There is either no solution available or it is impossible to apply.
``W`` ``Workaround``       There is an unofficial, non-vendor solution available.
``T`` ``Temporary Fix``    There is an official but temporary fix available.
``O`` ``Official Fix``     A complete vendor solution is available.
========================== ===============================================================================================

RC | Report Confidence
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This metric measures **the degree of confidence in the existence of the vulnerability** and **the credibility of the known technical details**. 
The more a vulnerability is validated by the vendor or other reputable sources, the higher the score.

============================================= ====================================================================================================================================================================
Metric Value                                  Description
============================================= ====================================================================================================================================================================
``X`` ``Not Defined``                         Assigning this value indicates there is insufficient information to choose one of the other values. It has the same effect on scoring as assigning Confirmed.
``C`` ``Confirmed``                           Detailed reports exist, or functional reproduction is possible (functional exploits may provide this).
``R`` ``Reasonable``                          Significant details are published, but researchers either do not have full confidence in the root cause.
``U`` ``Unknown``                             There are reports of impacts that indicate a vulnerability is present.
============================================= ====================================================================================================================================================================

Environmental Metrics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are 11 metrics in the Environmental Scoring equation, divided into 2 main categories:

- Security Requirements
   - ``CR`` ``Confidentiality Requirement``
   - ``IR`` ``Integrity Requirement``
   - ``AR`` ``Availability Requirement``
- Modified Base Metrics
   - ``MAV`` ``Modified Attack Vector``
   - ``MAC`` ``Modified Attack Complexity``
   - ``MPR`` ``Modified Privileges Required``
   - ``MUI`` ``Modified User Interaction``
   - ``MS`` ``Modified Scope``
   - ``MC`` ``Modified Confidentiality``
   - ``MI`` ``Modified Integrity``
   - ``MA`` ``Modified Availability``

CR, IR, AR | Security Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These metrics enable the analyst to customize the CVSS score depending on the importance of the affected IT asset to a user's organization, **measured in terms of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability**.
The greater the Security Requirement, the higher the score.

========================== ===============================================================================================
Metric Value               Description
========================== ===============================================================================================
``X`` ``Not Defined``      Assigning this value indicates there is insufficient information to choose one of the other values. It has the same effect on scoring as assigning Medium.
``H`` ``High``             Loss of ``CIA`` is likely to have a catastrophic adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization.
``M`` ``Medium``           Loss of ``CIA`` is likely to have a serious adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization.
``L`` ``Low``              Loss of ``CIA`` is likely to have only a limited adverse effect on the organization or individuals associated with the organization.
========================== ===============================================================================================

.. note::

   The same table is used for all three metrics.

Modified Base Metrics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These metrics enable the analyst to **override individual Base metrics based on specific characteristics of a user's environment**.
Characteristics that affect Exploitability, Scope, or Impact can be reflected via an appropriately modified Environmental Score.

The values used for each metric are the same values as the corresponding Base Metric, as well as ``Not Defined``.

Vector String
-------------
The CVSS v3.1 vector string is a **text representation of a set of CVSS metrics**.
It is commonly used to record or transfer CVSS metric information in a concise form.

The CVSS v3.1 vector string begins with the label ``CVSS:`` and a numeric representation of the current version, ``3.1``.
Metric information follows in the form of a set of metrics, each preceded by a forward slash, ``/``, acting as a delimiter.
Each metric is a metric name in abbreviated form, a colon, ``:``, and its associated metric value in abbreviated form.

Example
~~~~~~~
For example, a **vulnerability with Base metric values** of:

============================== ===================
Base Metric                    Value
============================== ===================
``AV`` ``Attack Vector``       ``N`` ``Network``
``AC`` ``Attack Complexity``   ``L`` ``Low``
``PR`` ``Privileges Required`` ``H`` ``High``
``UI`` ``User Interaction``    ``N`` ``None``
``S`` ``Scope``                ``U`` ``Unchanged``
``C`` ``Confidentiality``      ``L`` ``Low``
``I`` ``Integrity``            ``L`` ``Low``
``A`` ``Availability``         ``N`` ``None``
============================== ===================

and no specified Temporal or Environmental metrics, would produce the following vector:

``CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N``
