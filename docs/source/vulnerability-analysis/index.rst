Vulnerability Analysis
======================
Vulnerability Analysis is where we dive deeper into the information that we have found.

In this phase, our goal is to **look for exploits or vulnerabilities** that we can leverage for our next phase.
For example, from the service versions that we have found from the previous step, we could look for vulnerabilities that existed for that specific version.

This phase is more geared towards research.
This is where we do our due diligence in investigating and learning common vulnerabilities.
